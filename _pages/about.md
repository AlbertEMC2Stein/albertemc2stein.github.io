## Who am I?

Hello, I'm [Tim](#){: target='_blank'}. I'm a mathematician and a computer scientist from Germany. I'm currently studying at the Technical University of Kaiserslautern.


## What do I do?

As a mathematician, I'm interested in the properties of complex numbers and their applications in mathematics and computer science. I like to solve problems and to think about algorithms. My favorite programming language is Python.

I'm currently working on a project that simulates the spread of a viral infection in a population of people. The project is called [COVID19-CNS,](./COVID19-CNS) and it's written in Python. I am also working with Physics-informed neural networks for my research.


## Why do I do it?

It all started with a simple question: "Why do I do it?" And the answer was: "Because I like it." I like programming because it's fun, and it's easy to learn. I like mathematics because it's beautiful, and it's easy to understand. I like computers because they're easy to use, and they're easy to repair. I like to solve problems because they're fun to solve. And I like to think about algorithms because they're easy to implement.

## How do I do it?

Well, wih Python. And also with determination, persistence, passion, a little luck, and a lot of coffee.
